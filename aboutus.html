                Avalanches can happen whenever there is snow lying on the ground
                at a sufficient angle. Every year there are avalanche accidents
                in Whistler. While there is always an avalanche risk in winter,
                some of these accidents could have been avoided by awareness and
                planning.

                The two most common causes of hypothermia on the hill are
                exhaustion and injury. Walkers with inadequate food, clothing
                and shelter will not be able to sustain the level of physical
                work to replace the heat they are losing. Injury leads to
                immobility and a similar inability to generate heat – just think
                how you cool, off when you stop for your 'piece'.
