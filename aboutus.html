                  Our search and rescue crew is an elite team of highly trained
                  professionals, each forged through years of experience in some
                  of the harshest and most demanding environments on Earth.
                  Comprising climbers, alpinists, military veterans, wilderness
                  survival experts, paramedics, and specialized rescue
                  operators, our team is built on a foundation of grit, skill,
                  and unyielding dedication to saving lives. Every member
                  undergoes intensive training that pushes them beyond their
                  limits—learning advanced rope rescue techniques, helicopter
                  extractions, swift-water operations, avalanche response, and
                  emergency medical care in extreme conditions. They are no
                  strangers to adversity, having spent years honing their craft
                  on sheer rock faces, navigating treacherous alpine terrain,
                  and enduring the unpredictable elements of the wilderness.
                  Whether it’s scaling vertical cliffs to reach stranded
                  climbers, navigating through blizzards to locate missing
                  hikers, or diving into raging waters for a swift-water rescue,
                  our team thrives in situations where others cannot. What makes
                  them truly exceptional is not just their physical ability but
                  their unwavering mental toughness, their ability to make
                  split-second life-or-death decisions, and their commitment to
                  risking everything to bring people home. When disaster
                  strikes, we are the ones who answer the call—no matter the
                  conditions, no matter the challenge.

                  With a team composed of elite professionals from backgrounds
                  in alpine climbing, backcountry skiing, military service, and
                  technical rescue, there are few situations we aren’t prepared
                  for. Our diverse skill set and specialized training allow us
                  to execute complex operations in nearly any environment, from
                  rugged mountain peaks to swiftwater rapids and dense forest
                  terrain. We conduct long-line helicopter rescues, allowing us
                  to extract individuals from sheer cliffs, avalanche paths, and
                  inaccessible wilderness areas with speed and precision. Our
                  high-angle rope rescue teams are capable of executing
                  technical extractions from deep crevasses, rock faces, and
                  unstable terrain where traditional methods fall short. In
                  extreme cold environments, our glacier and alpine rescue
                  specialists navigate dangerous ice fields, avalanche zones,
                  and high-altitude conditions to reach those in distress.
                  Beyond the mountains, we excel in swiftwater and ice rescues,
                  using specialized gear and training to perform operations in
                  fast-moving rivers, frozen lakes, and flood zones. When
                  conditions turn unpredictable, our wilderness search teams
                  utilize GPS tracking, searchlights, drones, and K9 units to
                  locate missing persons in even the most remote areas. With the
                  talent and expertise on our team, there is no mission too
                  demanding, no terrain too extreme, and no conditions too
                  harsh. Whether it's a high-altitude rescue, a flood
                  evacuation, or an off-grid medical emergency, we are always
                  ready to answer the call.

                Avalanches can happen whenever there is snow lying on the ground
                at a sufficient angle. Every year there are avalanche accidents
                in Whistler. While there is always an avalanche risk in winter,
                some of these accidents could have been avoided by awareness and
                planning.

                The two most common causes of hypothermia on the hill are
                exhaustion and injury. Walkers with inadequate food, clothing
                and shelter will not be able to sustain the level of physical
                work to replace the heat they are losing. Injury leads to
                immobility and a similar inability to generate heat – just think
                how you cool, off when you stop for your 'piece'.
